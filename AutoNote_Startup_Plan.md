# AutoNote: AI Startup Plan

This document outlines the strategic plan for creating AutoNote, an AI-powered note-taking application.

## 1. Executive Summary

*   **Mission:** To create an intelligent note-taking assistant that seamlessly captures, transforms, and connects ideas from any format.
*   **Vision:** To become the go-to platform for effortless knowledge management and creativity enhancement.
*   **Problem:** People capture notes in various formats (voice memos, pictures of whiteboards, quick text), leading to disorganized and underutilized information. Existing tools lack the intelligence to unify and contextualize this data automatically.
*   **Solution:** AutoNote is an AI-powered application that transforms audio, photo, and text notes into a consistent, searchable text format. It allows users to select the tone of the output (e.g., simple, business, funny) and uses a vector database to surface related information, providing deeper insights into their knowledge base.

## 2. Product Deep Dive

### 2.1. Core Features
*   **Multi-Modal Input:**
    *   Audio recording and transcription (Speech-to-Text).
    *   Image capture with intelligent analysis:
        *   OCR for text-heavy images (e.g., documents, whiteboards).
        *   Image description for photographic content.
    *   Standard text input.
*   **AI Note Transformation:**
    *   Core AI model to unify inputs into a structured text note.
    *   Style selection for note transformation (e.g., Simple, Business, Academic, Creative, Funny).
*   **Data Organization & Security:**
    *   **Workspaces (Spaces):** Users can create separate spaces to organize their notes (e.g., "Personal," "Work Project"). Data is strictly isolated between spaces.
    *   **Hierarchical Tree View:** Users can browse and organize their notes in a familiar folder and sub-folder structure.
    *   **Collaboration:** Team Workspaces can be created and shared with other users.
    *   **Permissions:** Workspace owners can assign roles to invited users (e.g., "Editor" with full edit rights, or "Viewer" with read-only access).
    *   **Note History & Versioning:** Every significant action on a note (creation, AI transformation, edit) is saved as a new version. Users can view this history and revert to a previous version of the note.
*   **Knowledge Discovery:**
    *   **Standard Semantic Search:** Find related notes *within the active space* using keywords or phrases.
    *   **Conversational AI Search ("Ask Your Notes"):** Ask complex questions in natural language and get summarized answers based on the content of your notes.
    *   **Tagging and categorization (manual and AI-suggested).
    *   **Note Visualization:** A visual representation of note connections.
        *   **Graph View:** Shows notes as nodes and semantic relationships as connecting edges.
        *   **Map View:** Places notes on a map if they have location data.
*   **Data Storage & Sync:**
    *   Securely store all notes and media in a primary database.
    *   Cross-device synchronization (Web, Mobile, Desktop).

### 2.2. User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI)
*   Describe the user flow from capturing a note to seeing the transformed output.
*   Wireframe sketches or mockups.
